I am a backend software developer having 1 to 2 year experience. Please help me.
I want to design a very simple user management system.
Below are specifications:
	. user can register with email (5 to 25 letter)and password (6 letter any combination).
	. then user will get a link for registration in API response itself.
	. the registration link contains a token of standard length.
	. after cliking on the link registration completes.
	. then user can login with username and password.

Based on this please generate detailed software requirement specifications for each API.
Typical API should include:
	. endpoint name
	. method type
	. input param (mandatory as well as non mandatory) (path parameter or query parameter, request body parameter, header parameter)
	. output response code for success
	. output response body for success
	. output response code for failure
	. output response body for failure

Note: 
	. there is no password encryption required.
	. it is a Docker based solution.
	. there is no front end to be considered.
	. backend development to be done using Python based framework.
	. database is SQLite.
	. have an endpoint to know version of the implementation /version
	. generate a mind map image with all possible details, use standard way to generate mindmap. Mention only API related details only. nothing about deployment. Nothing about Database. Have spelling of all words correct. Double check on typo error.
	. mention all required database schema, or query to be run on database. for required CRUD on database tables.
	. generate a word document with all requirements mentioned in easy but consistent way. In future the same document will be used to feed as input to automatically generate code.

Thanks, now please provide:
	. implement the same using Python based framework. implement all required code, nothing to be left to be implemented.
	. have sufficient logging in debug mode.
	. avoid hard coding of items e.g. status code.
	. only support following status codes: 200, 201, 202, 400, 401, 403, 500
	. Be consistent in naming variable etc.
	. name of the app, database or relevant commonly used items should prefix with "user_mngt".
	. provide step by step or detailed steps for running code on docker so any software engineer with not much experience can do the setup.
	. provide link if any sample youtube video in case got stuck in code deployment etc.

Thanks, now please provide:
	. test cases to test this entire system.
	. include positive and negative test cases with popular testing methodologies.
	. in negative test cases include boundary value analysis technique for each field of api.
	. group the test cases based on positive and negative types.
	. manual testing using POSTMAN:
		1. prepare complete and ready to use postman collection, which can be simply imported in POSTMAN.
	. implement api testing framework using Python, cover all test cases, use Pytest framework.
		1. avoid hard coding of items e.g. status code
		2. when a scenario fails, then during assertion print response code and response body.
		3. implement all setup and teardown fixtures.
		4. do not leave any coding part unimplemented.
		5. framework should have execution report generation, automatically generated. 
		6. report should be in html format so can be viewed in browser easily.
